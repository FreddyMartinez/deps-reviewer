[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-ISC-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/ISC)

This package is intended to provide some insights into the maintainability of a project. By reviewing the chain of dependencies it can pinpoint which ones are at risk of being deprecated or abandoned.

## Features

This tool queries the npm registry to gather statistical data about a single package or a list of dependencies. It explores the data in order to give some insights into their overall health and suitability for inclusion in a project.

## Usage

To use the Dependency Scout, you can install it globally using the `npm i -g deps-scout` command and then run the `scout` command in your project, or you can just run the `npx deps-scout` command directly.
